# Phakphum Jatupitpornchan

Hi! I am an MRes/PhD student in Economics at the University of Warwick. My research interests are in the field of macro development. For example, misallocation, structural transformation, spatial disparity.

Prior to starting graduate school, I worked as a researcher at the Thailand Development Institute, where I wrote several policy papers commissioned by Thai government agencies and UNICEF Thailand. I also wrote newspaper articles and blogs discussing topics such as inequality and social protection, which can be found [here](https://phakphumj.github.io/MyWebpage/Publications.html).
